    <h1>Why</h1>
    <h4>Becuase it isn't always easy to share how your startup is actually doing.</h4>

    When you are part of a startup, it's hard to be honest about what's really happening. Putting on a smile and being optimistic to the world is the norm in this community. You don't want the people closest to you to worry, so you bottle it up. This isn't healthy and it's also not good for your company. 

    If something is wrong, it helps to get it out, to be brutally honest about what issues are plaging you at the moment. It's also nice to see that others are feeling the same and that you're not the only one with issues. This is Entrepreneurs Anonymous, a safe place for you to air your hardships without being judged and more the fuck on.
